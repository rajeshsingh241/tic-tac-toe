Project Overview
This project implements a web-based version of Tic-Tac-Toe, where two players can interact with the game through a simple, easy-to-use 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their squares with an "X" or "O" until one of them aligns three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game provides a reset option, allowing for multiple rounds of fun.

Features
Simple Gameplay: Play with a friend on the same device. No need for an account or any special setup.

User-friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive 3x3 grid interface makes it easy to jump right in and play.

Dynamic Win Check: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if it's a draw.

Reset Option: Easily restart the game after each match.

Responsive Layout: Whether you play on desktop or mobile, the layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes.

How to Play
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

The first player (X) takes the first turn by clicking on an empty square. Then, player 2 (O) takes their turn.

The game checks for a winner after each move. The first player to get three marks in a row wins!

If all squares are filled and there’s no winner, it’s a draw.
